Irradiation
=================

Irradiations maybe imported in bulk using an Excel file. Use "Irradiation Template" to generate a blank boilerplate
irradiation file. Fill in the required information, such as irradiation name, irradiation levels and positions. When the
file is fully populated use "Import Irradiation File" to load the irradiation into the database.
